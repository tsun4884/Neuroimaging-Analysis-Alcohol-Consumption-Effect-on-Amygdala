## Project Summary

This project analyzes the impact of alcohol consumption on amygdalar gray matter volume and FDG PET standardized uptake value ratios (SUVr) in healthy young adults. Using structural MRI and PET data, MATLAB was used to segment the amygdala, calculate gray matter volume, and assess FDG uptake.
No statistically significant differences were observed between drinkers and non-drinkers; however, the study demonstrates a reproducible neuroimaging workflow using multimodal imaging and MATLAB-based analysis.

- The core script is `NeuroFinalProject.m`
- Designed to run in MATLAB
- Data preprocessing and visualization were done using SPM12 and custom MATLAB functions
